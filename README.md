Find a Doc is a web application which lets you find a doctor specific to your condition and set up an appointment from home. People are not always aware of the different doctors available throughout the country, who are specialized for treating a medical condition. Often times, we end up going to the same doctor over and over again, without getting any fruitful treatment, and many people do not want to face the burden of physically going to hospitals to check their available doctor’s list. Find a doc is aimed to help patients see lists of doctors from all around the country, who treat in different hospitals and set up an appointment with them. There’s a big gaping hole in the current market where, when people get sick, they don’t know what to do, many go to the doctors they have known for a while but they might not be the perfect person to visit and people end up paying their time and many, and many times the doctors would prescribe medicine instead of referring to an appropriate Doctor who specializes in that field. So this web application helps you cut the middle man and save you time, money and any risk associated with waiting long enough to visit the person who can make a better diagnosis.
Users, both doctors and patients can register and use the website accordingly. The patient can login and select a suitable doctor specific to the condition by selecting the doctors specialized to treat the probable disease, from the list of diseases. The patient can then set an appointment with any of the doctors in the list of doctors and select a suitable time. The doctor will send a confirmation message to the patient after confirming the appointment, so that there is no clash with prior appointments of the doctor from other sources. Doctors can also register and login and check their list of appointments.
